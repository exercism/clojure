For learning resources and help with installation, refer to the
[[http://exercism.io/languages/clojure][Exercism help page]]

To run the tests provided, you will need to install [[http://leiningen.org][Leiningen]].

To install Leiningen on Mac OS X using [[http://brew.sh][Homebrew]], run the following command:

    brew install leiningen

For help installing on Linux, Windows or without Homebrew see:

In an exercise directory, create a `src` directory and a file therein to hold
your solution. The name of the file should be the exercise name with dashes `-`
replaced by underscores `_`.  For example, if the exercise is called
`hello-world`, name the solution file `hello_world.clj`.

Your resulting file tree should look something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    /path/to/hello-world
    
    ├── project.clj
    ├── src
    │   └── hello_world.clj
    └── test
        └── hello_world_test.clj
#+END_EXAMPLE


To run the tests, navigate to the exercise directory and run the following
command:

    lein test
