**Exercism exercises in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)**

This is the Clojure track, one of the many tracks on [Exercism][web-exercism].
It holds all the _exercises_ that are currently implemented and available for students to complete.
The track consists of various **concept** exercises which teach the [Clojure syllabus][web-syllabus], and various practice exercises, which are unlocked by progressing in the syllabus and can be used to practice concepts learned.
You can find this in the [`config.json`][file-config].

## Running the test suite

To test all exercises with sample solutions using [babashka](https://babashka.org/):

```bash
./test.clj .
```
{:tested 86, :fails ()}
