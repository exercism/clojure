# Instructions append

## Implementation tips

- The instructions use lists because they are synced with a shared repository to maintain consistency across tracks.
  However, for this exercise in the Clojure track, you should assume that you are working with vectors instead of lists.
- It is important not to reuse existing Clojure built-in functions with similar functionality, as doing so would diminish the intended learning value of the exercise.
  Some of these functions include `into`, `concat`, `cat`, `lazy-cat`, `mapcat`, `flatten`, `filter`, `filterv`, `remove`, `count`, `map`, `mapv`, `reduce`, `transduce`, `reverse`, and `rseq` from the **clojure.core** namespace.
