# Instructions append

## Appendix

The instructions are synced with a shared repository to maintain consistency across all language tracks.
For this exercise in the Clojure track, assume that both the input and output are vectors.

It is important not to reuse existing Clojure built-in functions with similar functionality, as doing so would diminish the intended learning value of the exercise.
Some of these functions include `into`, `concat`, `cat`, `lazy-cat`, `mapcat`, `flatten`, `filter`, `filterv`, `remove`, `count`, `map`, `mapv`, `reduce`, `transduce`, `reverse`, and `rseq`, all from the **clojure.core** namespace.
