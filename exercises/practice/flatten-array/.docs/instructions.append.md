## Appendix

~~~~exercism/note
The instructions above are synchronized with a shared repository to ensure consistency across all language tracks.
This appendix provides additional clarification or modifies the instructions as needed to better align with the goals of the Clojure track.

For this exercise in the Clojure track, you may **assume that the input and output are vectors**, as indicated by the tests.
However, this is not a strict requirement; you are free to assume that the input is any nested combination of sequential things (lists, vectors, etc.), and the output is a sequence.
