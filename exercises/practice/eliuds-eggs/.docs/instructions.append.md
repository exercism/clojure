The instructions above are synchronized with a shared repository to ensure consistency across all language tracks.
This appendix provides additional clarification or modifies the instructions as needed to better align with the goals of the Clojure track.

It is important not to use existing built-in functions with similar functionality to the function are implementing, as doing so would diminish the intended learning value of the exercise.
In Clojure, there is no built-in function to count the number of bits in a number, so you may use any Clojure function in your implementation.
However, Java does include a function for this purpose: `bitCount`.
