# Instructions

Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.
A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.
The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation][modulo].

If a given number:

- is divisible by 3, add "Pling" to the result.
- is divisible by 5, add "Plang" to the result.
- is divisible by 7, add "Plong" to the result.
- **is not** divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string.

## Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
- 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".
