# Instructions

Note: This exercise is called "sublist" to remain consistent across tracks. But in Clojure lists are rarely used to represent data, so instead you will be dealing with vectors. Therefore, each occurrance of the word "list" in these instructions should be interpreted as "vector".

Given two lists determine whether :
- the first list is contained within the second 
- the second list is contained within the first list
- both lists are equal
- none of the above, lists are unequal

Specifically, a list A is a sublist of list B if by dropping 0 or more elements
from the front of B and 0 or more elements from the back of B you get a list
that's completely equal to A.

### Rules

Determine the relation between list1 and list2 and return the relation as a Clojure keyword.
The function `classify` should either return `:sublist`, `:superlist`, `:equal` or`:unequal`.


### Examples:

 * A = [1 2 3], B = [1 2 3 4 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3 4 5], B = [1 2 3 4 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3 4], B = [1 2 3 4 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [1 2 3], B = [1 2 3], A is equal to B
 * A = [1 2 3 4 5], B = [2 3 4], A is a superlist of B
 * A = [1 2 4], B = [1 2 3 4 5], A is neither a superlist, sublist nor equal to B : they are unequal
