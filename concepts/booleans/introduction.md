# Introduction

Booleans in Clojure are represented by `true` or `false`. All values are logically true or false. The only "false" values are `false` and `nil` - all other values are logically true.

Predicate functions (functions which return a boolean) will typically end with a question mark (`?`), but this is by convention only.

The core library includes functions for logical operators such as `not`, `and`, and `or`.
