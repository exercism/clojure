## Key Learnings

- Lists are collections.
- Lists can be created using [`list`][list] or by using a single quote.
- Clojure will try to evaluate lists, treating the first item as a function.
- Core functions:
  - [`first`][first] returns the first item in the list.
  - [`rest`][rest] returns the list without its first item.
  - [`count`][count] returns the number of items in the list.
  - [`conj`][conj] adds one or more items to the beginning of the list.
