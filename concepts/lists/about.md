# About

## Key Learnings

- Lists are collections.
- Lists can be created using `list` or by using a single quote.
- Clojure will try to evaluate lists, treating the first item as a function.
- Core functions:
  - `first` returns the first item in the list.
  - `rest` returns the list without its first item.
  - `count` returns the number of items in the list.
  - `conj` adds one or more items to the beginning of the list.
