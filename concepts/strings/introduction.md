# Introduction

A `string` in Clojure is a Java string, which is an object that represents immutable text as a sequence of Unicode characters (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.).

The `clojure.string` library provides many standard string manipulation and processing functions. In addition, all the usual Java methods for operating on strings are available via interop.
