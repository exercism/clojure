# Editor integration

The best way to develop Clojure is with an editor-connected REPL. Plugins are available for the most popular editors/IDEs:

- Emacs: [CIDER](https://cider.mx)
- IntelliJ: [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com)
- VSCode: [Calva](https://calva.io)
- Vim: [Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure)

See the [official docs](https://clojure.org/guides/editors) for more info.
